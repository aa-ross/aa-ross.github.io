<br/>
I recently graduated from The State University of New York at Albany with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. (I also have one in Psychology.)<br>As a student and a freelancer, I've had the chance to develop both web- and cloud-based applications, as well as design responsive websites using tools like Bootstrap and Bulma.<br>

I like working with:

<ul>
	<li>Java</li>
	<li>C#/.NET</li>
	<li>C/C++</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>SQL/MySQL/SQL Server</li>
	<li>Assembly Language (MIPS)</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>HTML5</li>
	<li>CSS3/Sass</li>
	
</ul>
